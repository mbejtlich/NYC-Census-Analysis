# Project Overview:
The goal of this collaborative project was to use census data to create two sensible models for predicting median household income and income per capita in New York City and the surrounding area. Two analytical approaches, Stepwise Selection and Shrinkage Methods, were used to select a subset of predictors. Using the variables selected, we performed multiple linear regression to model median household income and income per capita as a linear combination of the potential predictors. Starting from that baseline model, we added interaction terms and performed transformations on variables based on exploratory analysis and model diagnosis. Finally, an interpretation for each model was provided.

# Data Overview:	 	 	 					
The New York City Census Data is from the 2015 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates by census tracts with 2167 observations. For each census tract, 36 properties and demographic information were collected, for example total population, % under poverty level, median household income, unemployment rate and etc. Using supplementary census tract location data, we are able to show the distribution of income level on New York Map.
