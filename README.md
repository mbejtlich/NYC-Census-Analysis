# Project Overview:
The goal of this project was to use New York City Census Data (2015) to create two sensible models for predicting median household income and income per capita in New York City and the surrounding area. This was a collaborative team project involving two of my peers,
Yiwen Shen and Zhiwei Zhang.

We incorporated two analytical approaches, Stepwise Selection and Shrinkage Methods, to select a subset of predictors. Using the variables selected, we performed multiple linear regression to model median household income and income per capita as a linear combination of the potential predictors. Multiple linear regression is a useful statistical model for predicting a response on the basis of multiple redactor variables. Starting from that baseline model, we added interaction terms and performed transformations on variables based on exploratory analysis and diagnosis from the model. Finally, a interpretation for each model was provided.

# Data Overview:	 	 	 					
The New York City Census Data is from the 2015 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates by census tracts with 2167 observations. For each census tract, 36 properties and demographic information were collected, for example total population, % under poverty level, median household income, unemployment rate and etc. Using supplementary census tract location data, we are able to show the distribution of income level on New York Map.
